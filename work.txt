Hello,
Hope you are doing well! 

As I have mentioned earlier as well, we are doing a scheduled event on 17th June, Saturday.

Thoughtworks has a very unique and interesting interview process. We focus on object modeling, how well you follow OO principles with good problem-solving skills and of course the tech stacks you have used and a good in-depth understanding of your projects.

Since you have agreed to come down to our office I am sending the job description to you. There are few links as well which will help you understand what we mean when we say ‘good design’ and ‘clean code’. As you have enough time, I would really request you to go through all the links and attachments. Please go through all the videos and links provided with the email. It will be of great help to you.

Please read the book - Refactoring: Improving the design of existing code - by Martin Fowler. I promise you it will be worth your time. 

You can buy the Kindle version for Rs. 520 which you can read on your computer too. Or you can read the book at Safari books using their one month free trial. 

If you cannot make time to go through the whole book, do read the following chapters before coming in.

Chapter 1. Refactoring, a First Example (~1 hour read) 
I would highly recommend that you code along while reading this chapter. Martin has written this beautifully, with commentary at each minute step that he is taking in his journey to make the code better.

Chapter 3. Bad Smells in Code (~30 mins read)
Each of the code smells are really easy to understand, the trick is to reflect though on where and how often have you seen these smells in your code.

Chapter 4. Building Tests (~15 mins read)
If you are completely new to the idea of unit testing using frameworks like JUnit. If you have written even a few unit tests, you can skim through this chapter in 5 minutes.
Some guidelines for coding practices:

Just to re-iterate, things we look for in code

Clear and good object modelling
Clear and logical separation of responsibilities - (emphasis on single responsibility)
Things not dumped in at one place
Unit tests
Easy to understand, not too complex code (something which can be extended by any other person)and of course functional completion.

Your interview is confirmed for 17th June. I will be sending another email with venue details and the allotted time with few other instructions. 

Feel free to mail me back if you have any other queries.
