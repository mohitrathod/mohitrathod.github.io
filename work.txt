Hello Bikram,

Hope you are doing Good.

I would like to thank Oracle and you for giving me an opportunity to join the team to work on amazing stuff.

I regrate to let you know that I have analysed my expenditures in the city for next 2 year and found that I could have financial difficulties with the present salary offered.

Hense I have decided to not join the position offered.

Will stay in touch and I hope that I have explained my problem in sufficient detail.

Have a good day!
