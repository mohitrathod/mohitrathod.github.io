A Brilliant bud for pair programming and Confident to develop the solution to a problem. 

Working with Mohit is a delight and practical, we worked together for almost 2 years in Mortgage Pricer project and I certainly remember the design discussion we have gone thru and I found Mohit clearer on the point he brought.

I found Mohit a wise asset to the team technically and would like to work with him in future.
