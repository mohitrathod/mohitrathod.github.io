1) Return multiple values from a function in Python Example 

<pre>
def f(in_str):
    out_str = in_str.upper()
    return True, out_str # Creates tuple automatically

succeeded, b = f("a") # Automatic tuple unpacking

print ("var1" , succeeded , " var2" , str(b))

</pre>

2)  Loop Statement Example 

<pre>

print("-----")
print("for loop example ")

for letter in 'Python':     # First Example
   print ('Current Letter :', letter)

fruits = ['banana', 'apple',  'mango']
for fruit in fruits:        # Second Example
   print ('Current fruit :', fruit)

#Output :

#print ("Good bye!")

#Current Letter : P
#Current Letter : y
#Current Letter : t
#Current Letter : h
#Current Letter : o
#Current Letter : n
#Current fruit : banana
#Current fruit : apple
#Current fruit : mango
#Good bye!

print("-----")
print("Iterating by Sequence Index")

fruits = ['banana', 'apple',  'mango']
for index in range(len(fruits)):
   print ('Current fruit :', fruits[index])
   
#Output :

#Current fruit : banana
#Current fruit : apple
#Current fruit : mango   

print("-----")
print("Using else Statement with Loops")

for num in range(10,20):  #to iterate between 10 to 20
   for i in range(2,num): #to iterate on the factors of the number
      if num%i == 0:      #to determine the first factor
         j=num/i          #to calculate the second factor
         print ('%d equals %d * %d' % (num,i,j))
         break #to move to the next number, the #first FOR
   else:                  # else part of the loop
      print (num, 'is a prime number')
	  
#Output :

#10 equals 2 * 5
#11 is a prime number
#12 equals 2 * 6
#13 is a prime number
#14 equals 2 * 7
#15 equals 3 * 5
#16 equals 2 * 8
#17 is a prime number
#18 equals 2 * 9
#19 is a prime number

3)  Multiline comment Example

<pre>

'''
This is a multi line
comment.
You can use triple-quoted strings. When they're not a docstring (first thing in a class/function/module), they are ignored.
''' 

print("program starts after comments")

</pre>

4) how to swap variables in python ?

<pre>

Python evaluates expressions from left to right. Notice that while evaluating an assignment, the right-hand side is evaluated before the left-hand side.

	http://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#evaluation-order

That means to swap values from a to b and viceversa the following expression is correct 

	a,b = b,a :

5) Python Utilities that can be used to make everyday life easy
	
<pre>

print("Day_Over_Day_Rate_Adjustment".lower())

6) is Python pass by value or pass by reference ?
	
</br>
You can not pass a simple primitive by reference in Python, but you can do things like:	
	
<pre>

def foo(y):
  y[0] = y[0]**2

x = [5]
foo(x)
print x[0]

</pre>
	
That is a weird way to go about it, however. Note that in Python, you can also return more than one value, making some of the use cases for pass by reference less important:
</br>

<pre>

def foo(x, y):
   return x**2, y**2

a = 1
b = 2
a, b = foo(a, b)

</pre>
	
	
When you return values like that, they are being returned as a Tuple which is in turn unpacked.

</br>
Another way to think about this is that, while you can't explicitly pass variables by reference in Python, you can modify the properties of objects that were passed in. In my example (and others) you can modify members of the list that was passed in. You would not, however, be able to reassign the passed in variable entirely. For instance, see the following two pieces of code look like they might do something similar, but end up with different results:	

<pre>

def clear_a(x):
  x = []

def clear_b(x):
  while x: x.pop()

z = [1,2,3]
clear_a(z) # z will not be changed
clear_b(z) # z will be emptied

</pre>
