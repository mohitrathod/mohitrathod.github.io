Hey Mohit,

I just stumbled upon your python notes :http://mohitrathod.com/blog/python
Your examples totally rocks! so easy for anyone to understand!!
You wrote about web scraping too.
Luckly, I published a more in-depth 2200+ word tome laying out step by step how to scrape web pages.
I figured you might be interested in checking out our article:
https://likegeeks.com/python-web-scraping/

Would love to know your opinion on that article. And if youâ€™ll find it useful, please consider linking to it from that post of yours, or perhaps mentioning it in your future writing.
Either way, keep up your great work.

Thanks, Mohit!

Mokhtar
